# Parasite documentation

This is for the actual documentation of Parasite itself, describing how it
functions in a way you'll hopefully be able to understand...

The structure of this directory is like so:

```
routes/  - API routes.
  |- actions.md
  |- comments.md
  |- lists.md
  |- search.md
  |- identifiers.md
  |- torrents.md
  '- users.md
manual.md  - Administrator/User manual for Parasite - For simpeltons. 
readme.md  - This file, overviewing the directory.
```
